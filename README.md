# jnec-strike

It is a first person shooter multiplayer game on LAN which was made as the final year project for my undergrad course. It is developed on the Unity game engine and uses C# as its scripting language. It uses Unityâ€™s High Level Networking API to implement its multiplayer functionality on LAN. This game was inspired by Counter Strike. The main feature that distinguishes it from Counter Strike is that its maps are modeled on real life locations of the MGM campus and the player is modeled as a student of JNEC.
